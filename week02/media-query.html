            <h2>Mosiah 18:8-10</h2>
            <p>8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they
                called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are
                willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; 9 Yea, and are willing to mourn with
                those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God
                at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be
                redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life— 10
                Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the
                name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will
                serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</p>

            <p>16 And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord,
                saying: 17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of
                Jesus, and did worship him.</p>
