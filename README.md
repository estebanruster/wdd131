Learning web dynamics fundamentals. Working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
My name is Esteban Rub√©n Mangas Calva; I'm from Mexico and I'm currently a programmer and web design student.
I love to learn about tech and programming; specially the things related to videogames.
This repository is for the activities and projects for my class wdd131 Web Dynamics Fundamentals at BYUI through BYU Pathway Worldwide.
