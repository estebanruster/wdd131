Learning dynamic web fundamentals. Working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
My name is Esteban Rub√©n Mangas Calva; I'm from Mexico, I'm an entrepeneur and I'm currently a programmer and web design student.
I love to learn about tech and programming; specially the things related to videogames; and I'm interested in aplying gaming principles (gamification) in my projects (programming and web design).
This repository is for the activities and projects for my class wdd131 Dynamic Web Fundamentals at BYUI through BYU Pathway Worldwide.
The activities in this repository are individual assignments to practice and prove my learning of the dynamic web fundamentals, group assignments to improve my workteam and a final project that includes all the topics and learnings of this class.
