Learning web dynamics fundamentals. Working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
My name is Esteban Rub√©n Mangas Calva; I'm from Mexico and I'm currently a programmer and web design student.
I love to learn about tech and programming; specially the things related to videogames.
This repository is for the activities and projects for my class wdd131 Web Dynamics Fundamentals at BYUI through BYU Pathway Worldwide.
The activities in this repository are individual assignments to practice and prove my learning of the web dynamics fundamentals, group assignments to improve my workteam and a final project that includes all the topics and learnings of this class.
